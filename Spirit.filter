##### SPIRIT+ #####
SetOption $Spirit_Info info [Welcome to Spirit+! This item filter is designed for all players of Path of Exile - from the 10,000 hour veteran to the complete noob - across a variety of playstyles including solo self found, party play, and racing. The filter will hide items based on their apparent worth in the current area, or by item level. If an item is not relevant to your build as decided through the steps ahead, it is much more likely to be hidden. Exceptions to this include league restricted items, items you yourself add through overlays selected later on, and items used in item recipes. I hope you enjoy the filter, it's been a big project!]
SetOption $Customization_Info info [Be aware that fields cannot be left blank! Also note that typos break your preset (you can copy the url after it parses correctly to save your preset until those things change, which also allows sharing!). Most codes have their information exposed in the other tabs, so you can remove or add BaseTypes as you wish to fit your list. For example, in Extra, you can add $Quivers, then edit the Quivers entry in the Weapons tab, to select specifically the bases you're using. You can also alter the backgrounds from the Color Theme here in Filterblast if you want to mix it up. ]
SetOption $MF_Threshold switch [Rare] [Normal] [Magic] [Rare] [Unique] # Items below this cutoff will not highlight for your build even if they would otherwise do so. Set this to Normal if you're playing in a No Magic/Rare drops league, to Magic if you know what you're doing, and to Unique if you don't need any items for your build.

SetOption $Intro info [This item filter is designed for all players of Path of Exile - from the 10,000 hour veteran to the complete noob - across a variety of playstyles including trade, solo self found, party play, and racing. The filter will hide items based on their apparent worth to your build in the current area. Items with other notable qualities are shown with their own highlights.] # Welcome to Spirit+ | You can download the filter as is for a general approach or customize it to increase strictness towards your build in particular. 
SetOption $EmptyLine
SetOption $ExampleIconSizeSlider slider [-1] [0] [2] # Items have four size brackets that determine their minimap icon size : 0, 1, 2, and -1 (-1 removes the icon) - You can alter the minimap icon size on many items this way. Removing the icon requires editing the downloaded filter (just Ctrl+F [0] and you'll find all options for Icon Size).
SetOption $ExampleNameplateSizeSlider slider [32] [18] [45] # Items have a nameplate with a size between 18 and 45, which you can adjust in a similar way. By default these two sizes correlate with each other (-1 has a font of 18, then 24, 30, and 38, with 45 being limited to extremely valuable drops) and with the perceived potential value of the drop (which may adjust from those defaults).
SetOption $IconType info [Circles represent unidentified items. Hexagons represent identified items. Diamonds represent currency. Squares represent maps. Stars represent Uniques. Triangles indicate special bases. Crosses represent linked items. Moons represent fragments. Raindrops represent flasks. Kites represent Gems. Pentagons represent Jewels. UpsideDownHouse represents items with odd qualities, like recipe results and quest items or items that aren't typically dropped (eternal orbs, fishing rods etc).] # The possible minimap icons are Circle, Diamond, Hexagon, Square, Star, Triangle, Cross, Moon, Raindrop, Kite, Pentagon, and UpsideDownHouse.
SetOption $IconColor info [Red is for Corrupt items and extreme value highlights. Green is for Quest items and Custom Quests. Blue is for bracket 1 items. Brown is for maximally rare items. White is for items with unusual properties such as RGB links, high quality, or 6 sockets. Yellow is for bracket 0 items. Cyan is for items that may have value and need to be checked manually. Grey is for bracket 2 items. Orange indicates an item that is unusual in SSF. Pink and Purple indicate that an item is relevant to your build (Pink being the higher tier)] # The possible minimap colors are Red, Green, Blue, Brown, White, Yellow, Cyan, Grey, Orange, Pink, and Purple.

SetOption $Affixes_Info info [A single affix bracket can hold several tiers of affixes across a variety of properties. Bases which can roll a higher iLvl affix are denoted with a * and - for bases which fall off early, respectively.] # Affixes and mods are mostly interchangeable, an affix in the filter is referring to a quoted name "Dictator's" or "of Exile", and an affix group is the collection of names that make up a mod (short for modifier), like Flat Physical Damage or Chaos Resistance. Affixes have higher iLvl requirements as the bracket gets higher, and some bases are only able to reach limited brackets as compared to another base with the same affix family available. 
SetOption $Affixes_Info2 info [] # The filter is aware of whether a base is current or not, and so will discard sufficiently outdated bases regardless of affixes. Superqualifiers ignore the base, as especially in combination the affixes that superqualify can make up for a lower DropLevel base.

# TO DO Affix Filtering - Convoking Wand Modifiers, Flasks, Jewels x3, Watchstones, Experimented Bases

SetTab [Affixes - Customization]
SetOption $Disqualify switch [Hide] [Remove] # This toggle determines whether the filter discards an item with more outdated, junk, or counter-synergy affixes than your limit.
SetOption $SuperQualify switch [Show] [Remove] # This toggle determines whether the filter treats certain modifiers as exceptions to the Disqualifying rules.
SetOption $Strictness info [] # Each slider changes a different type of strictness, so raising or lowering one may not mean you should adjust another the same way. Keep in mind that Magic items can only have two affixes maximum (so strictness is hardcoded to 1 currently), and rare items can have up to six. < Setting a slider too high may affect items with open affix slots, so the optimal values depend heavily on your Disqualifier selections - the more Disqualifiers you have, and the higher your Disqualifier Strictness, the lower you can set Qualifier Strictness. >
SetOption $QualifierStrictness slider [3] [0] [6] # What number of outdated affixes is acceptable to you? This adjusts the baseline quality of your rare items - Example - A rare ring you find with 8% fire res will stop showing if dropped in an area where you could roll 15% if other mods don't qualify it. 
SetOption $DisqualifierStrictness slider [2] [0] [6] # What number of junk affixes is acceptable to you? At 6, the filter will only discard a rare item if every mod has a better version available on the base at that level and all available prefixes and suffixes are filled. At 1, the filter will discard an item with any number of junk mods regardless of available crafting space. A junk modifier is any affix which is set aside as undesirable to your build - Example - If you're looking for a particular elemental damage type and use Elemental Equilibrium, you can rule out mods with counter-synergies by setting them as Disqualifiers.
SetOption $SuperQualifierStrictness slider [1] [6] # Be very careful adjusting this slider, at 1 an item (regardless of rarity) only requires a single Super Qualifier to override any settings for Disqualifiers - higher numbers increase the strictness of this override severely. Super Qualifiers are those you add manually to the input at the bottom of this page (you can use the Affix Info tab as a reference), either as exceptions to show specifically top tier mods from off-build items, or as a targeting mechanism for dream items, or any other super-exception you'd want. Superqualifying items are allowed to have outdated bases (just in case).

SetOption $EmptyLine

SetOption $SuperQualifiers input ["Merciless" "Dictator's" "Flaring" "of Celebration"] # Put affixes you want to see here regardless of base type or disqualifying mods, you can check the full list in the Affix Info tab (currently only naturally spawning affixes). You can include any number of superqualifiers, just separate each quoted affix with a space. It's not recommended to have too many, or to use entire affix groupings (all flat phys affixes, when only the top 1-2 are useful at a given time based on iLvl). If you're looking for a particular affix combination you can do that here as well (ex: set superqualifier strictness to 2, add T1-2 flat and percent physical damage plus T1 attack speed modifiers to it, with no other modifiers, and when that item is dropped it'll pop.)

# TO DO - Add class/base exceptions, ie Virile on rings is T1. Or maybe just an item hunt input where you set the class + affix combination

SetOption $EmptyLine
# Brackets are for leveling, items which cap out their tier early are excluded.
SetOption $AffixBrackets info [] # Each bracket contains the mods that become outdated by item level, which is checked every 5 iLvls until maps, then more granular (mostly +2 per). Sometimes multiple tiers of an affix group will fall into the same bracket, and often affixes skip multiple brackets before updating. Affixes that cap out their tier early are treated as the top bracket except where this is due to a base restriction. Affix brackets are for sorting purposes, rather than highlighting, so even the top tier bracket will contain typically disqualified affixes (like phys thorns and flat life regen). Sometimes different base types diverge on the bracket which the same affix falls into (requiring a higher iLvl on one but not another), or are +/- 1 iLvl off of a bracket, so highlighting can't be perfectly exact (but this gets a close approximation).

Mods that cap out on one base very early (some affixes appear on rings only in low tiers, but also on amulets or other bases at higher tiers) are not treated as top tier (rather, those bases stop being great combinations with the affix).
